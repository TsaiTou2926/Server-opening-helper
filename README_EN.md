# Server-opening-helper
Just a GUI for starting Minecraft server

# Main Function
Running a server is no longer a distant task. Say goodbye to small black windows and commands!
```diff
- Be sure to place it in the server folder after downloading, otherwise it will fail
```

### Novice Friendly
1. New startup will automatically create Eula.txt
2. The Java path selector automatically points to the Java installation path

### Planning
Added the ability to edit server.propertis

### Warn
Program is **only Traditional Chinese** now
